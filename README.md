# FOVNET (Fog-based Vehicular Network)



# Intelligent Road Safety with Fog Computing

This project implements a vehicular communication system based on **Fog Computing**, developed and tested using the **Eclipse MOSAIC 25.0** simulation framework. The system enables reliable, low-latency data exchange between vehicles (OBUs), Road-Side Units (RSUs), and a Fog node, with the ultimate goal of improving road safety.

For a better understanding of the project please read the [article](Article.pdf).

## 🚗 Project Purpose

The aim of this project is to design and simulate a **custom multihop forwarding protocol** to ensure robust connectivity between vehicles and the Fog server. By leveraging ad hoc V2X communication and central Fog processing, the system is capable of:
- Creating a dynamic awareness map of neighboring vehicles,
- Optimizing forwarding paths based on proximity and hop count,
- Issuing real-time commands such as slow down, stop, or resume,
- Reacting to emergency vehicles in traffic scenarios.

## 🔧 Technologies and Tools

- **Eclipse MOSAIC 25.0** — Co-simulation framework for mobility and communication networks.
- **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)** — Used to simulate traffic behavior.
- **Java** — Main programming language used for OBUs, RSUs, and the Fog node logic.
- **Ad hoc Networking (V2X)** — Communication model for vehicles and RSUs.

## ▶️ How to Run It

### Requirements

- Installed and configured [**Eclipse MOSAIC version 25.0**](https://eclipse.dev/mosaic/post/release-25-0/)
- Linux shell or WSL (for `compile.sh` script)

### Steps to Build and Run

1. **Edit the build script `compile.sh`**:
   Set the following variables:
   ```bash
   BASE_DIR="/path/to/Network-Dir"
   TARGET_DIR="/path/to/eclipse-mosaic/scenario"
   ```

2. **Compile the project**:

   ```bash
   ./compile.sh
   ```

3. **Run the scenario**:
   From within the Eclipse MOSAIC root directory, execute:

   ```bash
   ./mosaic.sh -s vehApp_1
   ```

This will launch the simulation where regular vehicles yield to an emergency vehicle based on messages generated by the Fog.

## 🔍 Features Demonstrated

* Dynamic neighbor map generation through Beacon and VehInfo messages
* Multihop routing based on proximity and hop optimization
* Emergency reaction through event-driven Fog messages
* Vehicle behavior adapted in real time in a SUMO traffic environment

## 🧪 Future Work

The following improvements are planned:

* Integration of **knowledge-based opportunistic forwarding algorithms**.
* Evaluation and filtering of **message freshness** to prevent outdated data usage.
* **Unified message handling** via abstract classes (e.g., `Message` superclass).
* **Statistical performance evaluation** with metrics such as latency, throughput, and packet delivery using federation output.
